///Fake client: SwiftBike Share needs a kiosk estimator.
/// Goal: Calculate trip cost from minutes ridden.
/// Requirements
/// Prompt for trip minutes (int) and unlock fee and per-minute rate (double).
///
///
/// Total = unlockFee + minutes * perMinute.
///
///
/// Add a device fee computed as â‚¬0.01 per minute (use a constant), then add 21% VAT.
///
///
/// Output a clean breakdown: minutes, per-minute cost, device fee, VAT, grand total.
///
///
/// Demonstrate casting at least once (e.g., when turning cents into euros with Math.round approach, or casting minute math).
///
///
/// Bonus extensions (choose any)
/// Quarter-hour rounding: billable minutes are rounded up to the next 15 (use Math.ceil(minutes / 15.0) * 15).
///
///
/// Input guard: if the user enters negative minutes, treat them as 0 (one simple if).
